# segs // Sending Emails via Google Sheets
Google Apps Script for sending email with attachment via Google Sheets by triggering the checkbox.

I had a Google sheets table with a list of employees and checkboxes where I saw info about who signed certain documents.
I wanted to automate the table so it could send automated emails for me by checking the checkbox. 

I've found a YouTube tutorial for the script. It worked but had an issue with sending multiple emails at once. Tried looking for a mistake in the code but there was none. I believe it was logical error not syntaxical. Youtube and Google didn't help me, i reached out to my colleague from work and he tried consulting ChatGPT. I tried also before asking my colleague, but GPT was of no help. But he somehow found the solution.

# segs-main # is the file in which you can find the Google Script. 

# segs-table # is the Google Sheets sample table used with the script. Nothing special.
